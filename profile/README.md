# Bizarre Bytes Studio

Bizarre Bytes Studio is an indie game development organization comprised of two developers (just for now). With a passion for both fun and education, we strive to create innovative and entertaining games. Our first project is a unique take on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, built with the Python programming language. We believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and we're having a blast as we work to bring our vision to life. Whether it's for a few laughs or a chance to flex our programming muscles, we're dedicated to making games that will engage and delight players of all ages. Join us on our journey as we turn our bizarre bytes into brilliant games!
