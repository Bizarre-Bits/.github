# Bizarre Bits

Bizarre Bits is an independent game development studio comprised of two passionate developers. Our team is dedicated to creating immersive and entertaining games. Our first project, [Another Game Engine](https://github.com/Bizarre-Bits/AGE), is a custom-made game engine that we are building to understand the principles behind game engine development. With this project, we hope to gain the knowledge and skills needed to create amazing games that will leave players awestruck.

At Bizarre Bits, we strongly believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and we are having a great time as we work to bring our vision to life. Our goal is to use our skills and experience to create unique and entertaining gaming experiences that will leave a lasting impression on our players.

Join us on our journey as we turn our bizarre bits into brilliant games!
